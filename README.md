# Disguised Backup Bot (Discord)

A simple Discord bot with a few embed creation commands, that secretly allows you only to DM it and be unbanned from your own server and given admin role back, to use in the case of being hacked or having your server hijacked. In the code, you can choose the ID of the only user who will be able to do this, and to most people in a server it will just appear as a bot to create embeds easily.
